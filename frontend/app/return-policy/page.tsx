            Acme Returns Policy

            We want you to be completely satisfied with every purchase you make at Acme.

            This policy forms part of the Acme Terms and Conditions applicable to both our website, **[www.acme.co.za](http://www.acme.co.za)**, mobile application (“Website”), and in stores. Acme is committed to operating in line with the Consumer Protection Act, and all our policies are subject to applicable law.

            If you’re returning a product purchased at Acme, please note the following:

            * **Proof of purchase is required** for all products bought in-store or online (We’ll use your Acme account or loyalty card to retrieve your Tax Invoice, if not provided).
            * Once the product is assessed, Acme will either **refund or exchange** it within **7–14 business days**, or within **21 business days** for repairs. Refunds will be processed to the **original payment method**.
            * **Promotional, free, and bundled items** must be returned with the main product, unused and in the original packaging.
            * Some **product categories are non-returnable**.
            * Additional conditions may apply regarding **delivery costs, collection fees, and refund calculations**.
            * Returns are subject to **specific timeframes**, depending on the reason.
            * Except in cases of defects or damage, returned products must be **unused and in original packaging**.
            * **Online-only products** sold by third-party sellers are subject to specific terms. Refunds may be issued, with repairs or exchanges processed at Acme’s discretion.
            * **Faulty products** have specific return conditions based on warranty coverage.
            * Special rules apply to **food and consumable items**.

            Ensure that the product is returned in its **original packaging**, including all accessories and documentation. If packaging is missing (e.g., for electronics), Acme reserves the right to reject the return.

            ### Important Notes on Returns:

            * **Delivery costs will not be refunded**.
            * Acme reserves the right to **charge a collection fee** for failed pickup attempts (more than 2).
            * If a return is rejected, a **return-to-customer fee** may apply.
            * If Acme determines that a customer is **misusing the return policy or delivery benefits**, Acme reserves the right to suspend the customer’s account and take appropriate action.
            * **Partial returns** may affect promotional pricing. If a promotion is forfeited, the refund will reflect the **original (non-discounted) price**.
